To, 
The Hiring Manager, Monk Maze

Dear Sir/Madam,

    My name is Samirul Haque,  I am a Django developer with 2 years of experience, building and maintaining web applications.
    I specialize in creating REST APIs, handling databases, and ensuring smooth backend functionality. My recent work was with a freelancer and was working on small,
    mid level web applications using Django and Flask and learned about Django pretty much from there. I also learned about Authentication, docker from old job.  
    Currently, I am eager to apply my skills and grow further in a collaborative environment at your company.
  
Sincerely,
